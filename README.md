# Backpropagation in Convolutional Neural Networks from scratch using numpy

This is my mini project at university for the "Mathematics for Machine Learning" subject. I used NumPy to design an autograd model for a classification task (on MNIST). The presentation slide can be found in slide.pdf. If you find anything incorrect, please feel free to inform me; I'll be more than willing to fix it.

- **model.py**: model file, including Conv2D, padding, max pooling, flatten, ReLU, and cross-entropy loss.
- **train.py**: training code.
- **inference.py**: inference from an existing checkpoint (checkpoint.npz).
- **eval.py**: evaluate from an existing checkpoint.
- **eval_from_prerun.py**: evaluate from saved result NumPy arrays.
